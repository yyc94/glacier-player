//! Handle to the out-of-process music-video window (`glacier-video-window`).
//!
//! A COSMIC panel applet cannot spawn a real toplevel window — the libcosmic
//! applet runtime parents every surface it creates back into the panel. So to
//! "pop out" a music video we launch a tiny companion process that re-plays the
//! same HLS stream in its own window (the window GStreamer's video sink
//! creates). No decoded frames cross the process boundary: the child decodes
//! the stream itself.
//!
//! This type owns the child process and the pipe to its stdin. A background
//! thread reads the child's stdout (one event per line) and forwards each line
//! over an [`tokio::sync::mpsc::UnboundedSender`] that the app drains via a
//! subscription. See `docs/video-popout-plan.md` and the companion crate
//! `glacier-video-window` for the line protocol.
